# Colour Flash - a KTANEModKit module

![Colour Flash Module](http://atbweb.co.uk/ktanemod/colourflash/img/themodule.png "Colour Flash Module")

Colour Flash is an experimental module leveraging the newly-exposed [KTANEModKit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) for 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes'. It exploits the psychological effect known as the Stroop effect by prompting the defuser with a sequence of colour words, but not necessarily in the colour that the word indicates.
