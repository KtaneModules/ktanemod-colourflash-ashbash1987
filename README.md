# Colour Flash - a KTANEModKit module

![Colour Flash Module](http://atbweb.co.uk/ktanemod/colourflash/img/themodule.png "Colour Flash Module")

Colour Flash is an experimental module leveraging the newly-exposed [KTANEModKit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) for 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes'. It exploits the psychological effect known as the Stroop effect by prompting the defuser with a sequence of colour words, but not necessarily in the colour that the word indicates.

Visit https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-colourflash/releases to download the latest release of this module, or build it yourself with this source code and Unity.

Visit http://atbweb.co.uk/ktanemod/colourflash/ for a KTANE-like manual specifically for this module.

## Installation

Ensure that you are on the modpreview Beta of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes; in Steam, right click on the game and go to Properties, then go to the Betas tab, and in the drop-down, select modpreview. If all went well, you should be updating to the preview version, and once downloaded, the game's name should now have [modpreview] on the end of it.

Then, download the latest release of the module, and drop the ColourFlash folder into the '&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods' folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).

Finally, run Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, enable mods, and then you should be getting this module in play!
