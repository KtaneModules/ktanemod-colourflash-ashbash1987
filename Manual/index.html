            <h2>On the Subject of Flashing Colors</h2>
            <p class="flavour-text">
                It's easy to identify colors. Red, Blue, Green, etc. Turns out it's a bit harder when you display a word color in a different color though...
			</p>

            <p>
			<ul>
                <li>A color flash module will repeatedly flash a sequence of 8 different words representing colors in different colors.</li>
                <li>The possible colors are Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Magenta and White.</li>
                <li>There is also a Yes button and a No button on the module.</li>
                <li>Only <em>one</em> of the Yes and No buttons need to be pressed to disarm the module, but must be pressed at the correct time according to the rules below.</li>             
                <li>The color of the last word in the sequence determines which set of rules to follow below.</li>
                <li>Follow the rules down from the top-most rule, down to the bottom-most rule for the block that applies to your module.</li>
            </ul>

                        If the color of the word does not match the word itself three times or more in the sequence, press Yes on the first time in the sequence where the color of the word does not match the world itself.<br />
                        If the word Red is shown in Yellow color, or the word Yellow is shown in White color, press No when the word White is shown in Red color.<br />
                        Otherwise, press Yes the last time Green is either the word or the color of the word in the sequence.
